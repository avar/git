Sample programs callable through git-shell.  Place a directory named
'git-shell-commands' in the home directory of a user whose shell is
git-shell.  Then anyone logging in as that user will be able to run
executables in the 'git-shell-commands' directory.

Note that git-shell assumes its CWD is the user's home directory, so
trying to 'su' to a user whose shell is git-shell would result in
running commands out of "$(cwd)/git-shell-commands", which may not be
desired behavior.

Provided commands:

help: Prints out the names of available commands.  When run
interactively, git-shell will automatically run 'help' on startup,
provided it exists.

list: Displays any bare repository whose name ends with ".git" under
user's home directory.  No other git repositories are visible,
although they might be clonable through git-shell.  'list' is designed
to minimize the number of calls to git that must be made in finding
available repositories; if your setup has additional repositories that
should be user-discoverable, you may wish to modify 'list'
accordingly.
