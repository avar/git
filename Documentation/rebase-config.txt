rebase.stat::
	Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last
	rebase. False by default.

rebase.autoSquash::
	If set to true enable `--autosquash` option by default.

rebase.autoStash::
	When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
	before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation
	ends.  This means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree.
	However, use with care: the final stash application after a
	successful rebase might result in non-trivial conflicts.
	Defaults to false.

rebase.missingCommitsCheck::
	If set to "warn", git rebase -i will print a warning if some
	commits are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the
	rebase will still proceed. If set to "error", it will print
	the previous warning and stop the rebase, 'git rebase
	--edit-todo' can then be used to correct the error. If set to
	"ignore", no checking is done.
	To drop a commit without warning or error, use the `drop`
	command in the todo list.
	Defaults to "ignore".

rebase.instructionFormat::
	A format string, as specified in linkgit:git-log[1], to be used for
	the todo list during an interactive rebase.  The format will automatically
	have the long commit hash prepended to the format.
