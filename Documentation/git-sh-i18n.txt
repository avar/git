git-sh-i18n(1)
===============

NAME
----
git-sh-i18n - Common git shell script setup code

SYNOPSIS
--------
'. "$(git --exec-path)/git-sh-i18n"'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Like linkgit:git-sh-setup[1] this is not a command the end user would
want to run. Ever. This documentation is meant for people who are
studying the Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

The 'gitsh-i18n' scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using
`.`) by other shell scripts to set up some variables pointing at
the normal git directories and a few helper shell functions.

FUNCTIONS
---------

gettext::

eval_gettext::
	die with the usage message.
