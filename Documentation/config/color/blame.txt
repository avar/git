color.blame.highlightRecent::
	This can be used to color the metadata of a blame line depending
	on age of the line.
+
This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color and date settings,
starting and ending with a color, the dates should be set from oldest to newest.
The metadata will be colored given the colors if the line was introduced
before the given timestamp, overwriting older timestamped colors.
+
Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as well, e.g.
2.weeks.ago is valid to address anything older than 2 weeks.
+
It defaults to 'blue,12 month ago,white,1 month ago,red', which colors
everything older than one year blue, recent changes between one month and
one year old are kept white, and lines introduced within the last month are
colored red.

color.blame.repeatedLines::
	Use the customized color for the part of git-blame output that
	is repeated meta information per line (such as commit id,
	author name, date and timezone). Defaults to cyan.
