git-mktag(1)
============

NAME
----
git-mktag - Creates a tag object with extra validation


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mktag'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object. The
output is the new tag's <object> identifier.

This command is mostly equivalent to linkgit:git-hash-object[1]
invoked with `-t tag -w --stdin`. I.e. both of these will create and
write a tag found in `my-tag`:

    git mktag <my-tag
    git hash-object -t tag -w --stdin <my-tag

The difference is that mktag will die before writing the tag if the
tag doesn't pass a sanity check.

Tag Format
----------
A tag signature file, to be fed to this command's standard input,
has a very simple fixed format: four lines of

  object <hash>
  type <typename>
  tag <tagname>
  tagger <tagger>

followed by some 'optional' free-form message (some tags created
by older Git may not have `tagger` line).  The message, when it
exists, is separated by a blank line from the header.  The
message part may contain a signature that Git itself doesn't
care about, but that can be verified with gpg.
