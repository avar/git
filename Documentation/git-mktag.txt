git-mktag(1)
============

NAME
----
git-mktag - Creates a tag object with extra validation


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mktag'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object. The
output is the new tag's <object> identifier.

This command accepts a subset of what linkgit:git-hash-object[1] would
accept with `-t tag --stdin`. I.e. both of these work:

    git mktag <my-tag
    git hash-object -t tag --stdin <my-tag

The difference between the two is that mktag does the equivalent of a
linkgit:git-fsck(1) check on its input, and furthermore disallows some
thing linkgit:git-hash-object[1] would pass, e.g. extra headers in the
object before the message.

Tag Format
----------
A tag signature file, to be fed to this command's standard input,
has a very simple fixed format: four lines of

  object <hash>
  type <typename>
  tag <tagname>
  tagger <tagger>

followed by some 'optional' free-form message (some tags created
by older Git may not have `tagger` line).  The message, when
exists, is separated by a blank line from the header.  The
message part may contain a signature that Git itself doesn't
care about, but that can be verified with gpg.

HISTORY
-------

In versions of Git before v2.30.0 the "mktag" command's validation
logic was subtly different than that of linkgit:git-fsck[1]. It is now
a strict superset of linkgit:git-fsck[1]'s validation logic.
