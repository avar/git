How to write test cases
=======================

Create test cases called "LANG-whatever" in this directory, where
"LANG" is e.g. the userdiff driver name, where "whatever" is a brief
description of the test.

Insert the word "ChangeMe" (exactly this form) at a distance of
at least two lines from the line that must appear in the hunk header.

The text that must appear in the hunk header must contains the word
"RIGHT" by convention. The "LANG-whatever.ctx" file contains what we
expect to appear in the hunk header. We munged away the starting "@@
[...] @@" part of the line for ease of not having to hardcode the line
numbers and offsets.
